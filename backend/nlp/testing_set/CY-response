In a petition submitted to the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) today, the Center for Science in the Public Interest and Consumer Reports called on the agency to stop requiring the terms “Uncured” and “No Nitrate or Nitrite Added” on labels for meat processed with nitrates or nitrites from non-synthetic sources, such as celery powder. The groups urged the agency to revise its rule because the labels are misleading and may give consumers the false impression that these products are healthier.
Gaius Appuleius Diocles (104 – after 146 AD) was a Roman charioteer who became one of the most celebrated athletes in ancient history. He is often cited as the highest-paid athlete of all-time.[1][2] That condition, however, arises from the fantastic assumption that, as his wealth would have been enough to fund the entire Roman Army for more than two months, the apt comparison is what it takes to pay the wages of the American armed forces for the same period,[2] despite the fact that modern Americans are far wealthier and numerous than their Roman counterparts. A wheat-based approach, for comparison, yields $6.49 million in 2019.
After an initial focus upon E1b1b as a Neolithic marker, a more recent study in January 2010, looked at Y haplogroup R1b1b, which is much more common in Western Europe. Mark Jobling said: "We focused on the commonest Y-chromosome lineage in Europe, carried by about 110 million men, it follows a gradient from south-east to north-west, reaching almost 100% frequency in Ireland. We looked at how the lineage is distributed, how diverse it is in different parts of Europe, and how old it is." The results suggested that the lineage R1b1b2 (R-M269), like E1b1b or J lineages, spread together with farming from the Near East. Dr Patricia Balaresque added: "In total, this means that more than 80% of European Y chromosomes descend from incoming farmers. In contrast, most maternal genetic lineages seem to descend from hunter-gatherers. To us, this suggests a reproductive advantage for farming males over indigenous hunter-gatherer males during the switch from hunting and gathering, to farming".[58][59][60][61]

In 1991 she proposed a book on Native American cuisine to publishers in New York.[3] "They told me that Native people didn't have a cuisine", she recalled in a 2013 interview, "and that I didn't have the credentials to write any such book".
