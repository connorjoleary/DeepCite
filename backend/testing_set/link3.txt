The Mandela Effect is a phenomenon that makes us question even the most mundane memories from the past. In June 2019, the famed New York Times crossword puzzle made it the theme, and defined it as, "a recent refinement of false memory that typically refers to pop culture or current event references." Named by paranormal researcher Fiona Broome, it's basically remembering something that doesn't match with historical records. For example, the stuff you use to make your home smell fresh isn't "Febreeze" (more on that later).

Broome has said that she "loves" the idea that the Mandela Effect, or others claiming they distinctly recall different events or details, could be proof that we're existing in alternate realities. We're not so sure that's the truth, but these comparisons between popular belief and reality is making our jaws hit the floor as we type. Check out 40 of the most gobsmacking "facts" below.
