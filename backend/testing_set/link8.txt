During college Frank worked as a cook at the first Good Earth restaurant.[3] After graduation she worked in the advertising industry, photographing commercial shoots for Evian, Taco Bell and International House of Pancakes.[3]

A mentor, Ernst Haas, questioned the meaningfulness of her work[1] and encouraged her to explore her heritage.[3] She had a "moment of reckoning", realizing she was "making food that I wouldn't even eat look beautiful, and then promoting others to eat it".[3] In the 1980s, she started asking questions about Native American cuisine and "was told there was no such thing".[9] She told The New York Times: "But of course they had a cuisine, and it was intricate, diverse and delicious".[9] Around the same time she met Juanita Tiger Kavena, who had written Hopi Cookery (1980), one of the first cookbooks by a Native American cook.[1][12]

In 1991 she proposed a book on Native American cuisine to publishers in New York.[3] "They told me that Native people didn't have a cuisine", she recalled in a 2013 interview, "and that I didn't have the credentials to write any such book".[3] She returned to school to earn her master's degree and a doctorate in cultural anthropology, and recalls that "at the time, they were teaching that American cuisine was made up of immigrant populations. The traditions of Native kitchens were largely overlooked".[3]

She talked to and collected recipes from the Hopi,[1] Ute, Pueblo, and other Southwestern tribes, and in 2002 Ten Speed Press published her cookbook Foods of the Southwest Indian Nations,[3][13] in collaboration with Walter Whitewater (Din√©).[14] In 2003, the book won a James Beard Foundation Award, the first cookbook on Native American cuisine or by a Native American author so honored.[3][15][16][17] CNN called it "the first Native American cookbook to turn the heads of James Beard Foundation Award judges".[15]

In 2017 Frank was featured in Native American Food Movements, a public television documentary about traditional diets.[18]

She serves as a Culinary Ambassador Diplomat for the United States Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, travelling with Whitewater to Ukraine (2013), the United Kingdom (2015), and Russia (2016) to teach about Native American foodways.[19]
